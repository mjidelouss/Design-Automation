===============

1. If you are using other fonts, you may need to change the font extension (ttf, otf). You can do this in the following lines of code:

font_title_path = READY / folder_name / 'assets' / 'fonts' / 'title_font.ttf'
font_post_path = READY / folder_name / 'assets' / 'fonts' / 'post_font.otf'
